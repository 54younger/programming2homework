% This script computes a global threshold for a given grayscale image I, by
% choosing an arbitrary initial estimate of a threshold, grouping the
% pixels into two sets, one with intensity values larger than the
% threshold, the other with intensity values smaller or equal than the
% threshold and calculate the mean of both sets. The mean of these two
% means will be taken as the new threshold estimate and this procedure is
% repeated until there is no change between two threshold estimates anymore
%
% The algorithm is equivalent to k-means clustering with two clusters.
